                        <p><a href="images/Lawrence-Gabriel-Found-Photo-Perfect-Family.jpg">How do you take the perfect family photo?</a> It's a joke about the most fascinating photograph I've ever seen. I love the picture in part because there's something so brutally practical about it -- I believe the simplest ways are often the best ways. </p>
                        
                        <p>My process is unorthodox but built around the straight-forward idea of capturing you as honestly as possible. Remember, the photographer is not the creative part of your headshot, <em>you are the creative part</em>. With that in mind, we will develop and refine characters, I will coach you through your session, and we will review photos live on a large screen. If you are not entirely happy with your photos by the end of the session, you don't pay -- it is that simple.</p>

                        <h3>PREPARING FOR HEADSHOTS - Overview</h3>

                        <li>Actor headshots are not glamour headshots, that is to say they should NOT be purely about beauty or showing “you” — remember there is no one universal image that will get you any gig. Ultimately, you should end up with multiple images, showing a range of characters you can portray. Treat your headshot session as an audition — prepare characters in advance.</li><br>

                        <li>Clothing informs the characters you are portraying. Consider outfits that match the type of roles you see yourself in — what would your character wear? That said, don’t go overboard either. Stay away from tops that are too pattern-heavy, too bright, or solid white. Plan to bring at at least 12 tops/looks (and consider layering clothing to create additional looks); we will shoot at least 6 distinct looks.</li><br>

                        <li>Retouching should be very minimal: blemish and loose hair removal is ok, minor color/ light enhancements are ok, but no skin or under eye softening, no scar or other permanent feature removal. Casting directors want accurate pictures to judge. Makeup is important for this reason and I always recommend getting a makeup artist who specializes in this. If you do your own makeup, remember to keep it minimal; you should look almost as though you are not wearing makeup— think fresh, clean. Also, consider completing your look on location. For hair, stay simple but also think about the possibility of changing your style to match the character you are portraying.</li><br>

                        <p><strong>Please be aware that there will be two cats in the studio; please consider this prior to booking.</strong></p>
